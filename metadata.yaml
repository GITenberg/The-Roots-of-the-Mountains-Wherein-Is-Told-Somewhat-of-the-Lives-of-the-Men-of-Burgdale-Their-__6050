description: "The Roots of the Mountains: Wherein is Told Somewhat of the Lives of\
  \ the Men of Burgdale, Their Friends, Their Neighbors, Their Foemen, and Their Fellows\
  \ in Arms is a fantasy romance by William Morris, perhaps the first modern fantasy\
  \ writer to unite an imaginary world with an element of the supernatural, and thus\
  \ the precursor of much of present-day fantasy literature. It was first published\
  \ in hardcover by Reeves and Turner in 1889. Its importance in the history of fantasy\
  \ literature was recognized by its republication by the Newcastle Publishing Company\
  \ as the nineteenth volume of the Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library in April,\
  \ 1979.\nAccording to Graham Seaman, \"The Roots of the Mountains seems to be the\
  \ story that inspired the subplot of the Dunedain, wanderers of a fading heroic\
  \ past defending the frontiers of the Shire against the Orcs, and the loves of Aragorn,\
  \ Eowyn, Faramir, and Arwen in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.\"\nThis work and its\
  \ predecessor, The House of the Wolfings, are to some degree historical novels,\
  \ with little or no magic. Morris went on to develop the new genre established in\
  \ these works in such later fantasies as The Wood Beyond the World, Child Christopher\
  \ and Goldilind the Fair, The Well at the World's End, The Water of the Wondrous\
  \ Isles and The Sundering Flood.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
